# Diego - a language for the robotics and IoT


## Usage

Simply include the Highlight.js library in your webpage or Node app, then load this module. For more complex usage, see [highlight.js usage](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js#basic-usage).

### Static website or simple usage

Simply load this module after loading Highlight.js. You'll use the minified version found in the `dist` directory. This module is just a CDN build of the language, so it will register itself as the Javascript is loaded.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/diego.min.js"></script>
<!-- Use any stylesheet you'd like - though it's best to choose from 
	those in highlightjs core repo -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/highlightjs/styles/vs.css" />
<script type="text/javascript">
	hljs.highlightAll();
</script>
```

This will find and highlight code inside of `<pre><code>` tags; it tries to detect the language automatically. If automatic detection doesnâ€™t work for you, you can specify the language in the `class` attribute:

```html
<pre>
    <code class="language-diego">
    ...
    </code>
</pre>
```

For more details see [Highlight.js main page](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js#highlightjs).

### Using directly from jsDelivr

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release/build/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script
	type="text/javascript"
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/highlightjs-diego/dist/diego.min.js"></script>
```

### With Node or another build system

If you're using Node / Webpack / Rollup / Browserify, etc, simply require the language module, then register it with Highlight.js.

```javascript
var hljs = require('highlightjs');
var hljsDiego = require('highlightjs-diego');

hljs.registerLanguage('diego', hljsDiego);
hljs.highlightAll();
```
